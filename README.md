OMG, so I just finished Bank of Dave 2: The Loan Ranger, and I'm like, seriously, what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? It's got all this British goodness going on but also, I’m kinda tired, so maybe I missed some stuff, you know? 😂 The sequel energy is strong with this one, like, they’re really trying to keep that small-town hero vibe alive.

> Man, the part where Dave is out there fighting the big banks is wild. It feels like he’s basically Robin Hood in a suit, but with better hair, LOL. I love how they're still making big shots look like total clowns. I guess you can never get enough of sticking it to The Man, right?

So, I've been thinking, should we even be getting these moral life lessons from a  ? But then again, maybe I’m just overthinking things after 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   in a hurry 'cause everyone was talking about it. Peer pressure is real. 🤷‍♂️

And get this, they bring this new character in, and it's supposed to be a twist but felt more like a gentle nudge, y’know? Like, I was half expecting them to burst into song or something. Why do sequels always feel a bit awkward, like that second 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯 of a TV show that just kinda... exists? 

Also, halfway through I remember thinking I should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again ‘cause I was debating with myself over that plot point... wasn’t it a bit too convenient? Like they just wrapped it all up in a nice neat bow, not too shabby but definitely not inspired.

random_list = [1, 'Dave', 3.14, True]

Anyway, it was a ride, lots of twists but maybe not enough turns. I’m gonna crash now, hopefully with dreams of never actually having to open a bank. What a thought. 😴
